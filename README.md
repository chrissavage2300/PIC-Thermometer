# PIC-Thermometer

<b>6/19/2020-Initial Idea</b>

This was spawned from my previous idea of a bread proofing box. I know I can juts buy a thermometer, but why not just build one. I occasionally need something to read the current temperature.

* PIC16F15325
* Lithium Battery Powered with Charge circuitry
* MCP9700 sensor
* SSD1306 128x32 OLED display (SPI)
* Possible EEprom Logging
* On/Off Switch. No need to sleep
* Button for logging?

Should be a simple project (Famous last words)
